# Other 
## Current: Marktext v0.0.1

I try `npm run build:web`success version `v0.0.1` and `v0.0.2`of [Marktext](https://github.com/marktext/marktext) , Just a few small changes.

## ~~Todoing: Marktext v0.7.17~~
Since it is difficult to install some modules between 0.0.1 and 0.7.17, switch directly to version 0.7.17.

## Todoing: Marktext v0.14.0
  finshed v0.7.17: ipc & menu ;
  
  I took a look at the rest of the code, and found it to be quite different from the 0.7 version structure, so I went straight from the back.

TODO: 
- Create a module that mimics electron communication;
- Generate vue Menu component according to menu.js (to achieve minimum changes in the source code) ;
